# Doodles, vol. I
## Chapter 1: The learning process.

"How to get started? How am I supposed to start taking the first steps in whatever journey when I don't know the destination? Does this hypothetical destination exist, even?"

This repository is not meant to become a valuable insight into the learning process itself, nor a clever answer to these questions that every single human being had in mind at some point throughout their lives. However, I would want to emphasize the words `process` and `journey` since that is what these little doodles (as well as some helpful tools I will eventually share) will try to represent: there is no goal and no clear destination. There's only a journey that may feel like a bumpy ride at times, but that is the essential origin and destination of learning: we find the courage to visualize that mountain (apparently) too high to climb, clear up some misconceptions, acknowledge our mistakes, and try again.

"All our knowledge begins with the senses, proceeds then to the understanding, and ends with reason. There is nothing higher than reason"; none of us (you too are involved here, but so I am) knows what programming truly *is* - not yet, and `reason` feels like an unreachable peak on top of an impossible mountain. 

We're going through this together, though, and as long as we are *willing* to keep on keeping on, everything will be just fine.
